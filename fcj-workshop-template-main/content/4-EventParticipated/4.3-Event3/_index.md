#### 8:50 – 9:30 AM | Pillar 1 — Identity & Access Management
**Main content:**
- Modern IAM Architecture: Users, Roles, Policies best practices
- Avoiding long-term credentials and implementing temporary access
- IAM Identity Center: SSO implementation and permission sets
- SCP & permission boundaries for multi-account governance
- MFA implementation, credential rotation strategies, Access Analyzer utilization
- Mini Demo: IAM Policy validation and access simulation

**Key takeaway:**
Mastered modern IAM patterns, understood the critical importance of eliminating long-term credentials, and gained hands-on experience with policy validation tools. Learned multi-account security governance strategies.

#### 9:30 – 9:55 AM | Pillar 2 — Detection & Continuous Monitoring
**Main content:**
- CloudTrail organization-level logging and management
- GuardDuty threat detection and Security Hub centralization
- Comprehensive logging: VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, S3 access logs
- Alerting and automation with EventBridge integration
- Detection-as-Code approach for infrastructure and security rules

**Key takeaway:**

- Security Groups vs NACLs: practical application models
- WAF + Shield + Network Firewall integration
- Workload protection: EC2, ECS/EKS security fundamentals

**Key takeaway:**
Mastered network security layering approach, understood when to use different network security controls, and learned workload-specific security implementations for containers and compute services.

#### 10:40 – 11:10 AM | Pillar 4 — Data Protection
**Main content:**
- KMS: key policies, grants, and automated rotation
- Encryption at-rest & in-transit: S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB implementation
- Secrets Manager & Parameter Store rotation patterns
- Data classification frameworks and access guardrails

**Key takeaway:**
Deep understanding of AWS encryption services, learned practical patterns for secrets management and rotation, and understood how to implement data classification and protection strategies across different service types.

#### 11:10 – 11:40 AM | Pillar 5 — Incident Response
**Main content:**
- IR lifecycle according to AWS best practices
- Practical playbooks for common scenarios:
  - Compromised IAM credentials
  - S3 public exposure incidents
  - EC2 malware detection and response
- Snapshot creation, workload isolation, evidence collection procedures
- Automated response implementation using Lambda and Step Functions

**Key takeaway:**
Gained practical incident response skills with AWS-specific tools, learned automated response patterns, and understood how to implement security orchestration for faster incident resolution.

#### 11:40 – 12:00 PM | Wrap-Up & Q&A
**Main content:**
- Comprehensive review of all 5 security pillars
- Common pitfalls and real-world challenges in Vietnamese enterprises
- Security learning roadmap: Security Specialty and Solutions Architect Pro certifications

### Key Takeaways

- **Modern IAM Practices:** Mastery of identity and access management with zero-trust principles
- **Detection & Response:** Implementation of comprehensive monitoring and automated incident response
- **Infrastructure Security:** Network segmentation and workload protection strategies
- **Data Protection:** Encryption and secrets management best practices
- **Practical Application:** Real-world security scenarios and enterprise-specific challenges

### Work Applications

- Implement comprehensive security assessment using Well-Architected Security Pillar framework
- Redesign IAM architecture following modern best practices and eliminating long-term credentials
- Set up automated threat detection and response using GuardDuty, Security Hub, and EventBridge
- Implement network segmentation and workload protection for current infrastructure
- Establish data classification and encryption standards across all services
- Develop incident response playbooks and automation for common security scenarios

### Event Experience

Participating in "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3" on Well-Architected Security Pillar was an invaluable experience that provided comprehensive understanding of cloud security best practices and real-world implementation strategies.

#### Highlights
- **Expert-led Security Training:** Learning from AWS security specialists with deep enterprise experience
- **Hands-on Demonstrations:** Practical demos of IAM policy validation, threat detection, and incident response
- **Real-world Case Studies:** Learning from actual security incidents and response scenarios
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All 5 security pillars covered with practical implementation guidance

#### Important Lessons
- Security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process requiring constant monitoring and improvement
- Zero-trust architecture requires fundamental changes in how we approach identity and access management
- Automation is critical for effective security at scale, especially for detection and incident response
- Data protection must be implemented at every layer, from infrastructure to application level
