### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** AI-Driven Development Life Cycle

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 14:00, October 03, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Briefly Description:** The event introduced AWS’s new AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC) — a methodology that integrates Artificial Intelligence across all phases of software development: inception, construction, and operations. <br>&emsp;
 Main activities included keynote presentations by AWS experts, live demonstrations of AI-assisted coding and deployment, hands-on sessions using AWS tools (such as Amazon CodeWhisperer and Kiro IDE), and interactive discussions on how human-AI collaboration reshapes modern development workflows. 

&emsp;**Outcomes:** Through the event, I gained insights into how AI can act as a proactive collaborator rather than just a support tool. I learned the principles of AI-native software development, where automation, continuous feedback, and human oversight coexist.<br>&emsp;
The workshop enhanced my technical understanding of agentic workflows and AI-powered code generation, as well as soft skills like adaptability and teamwork in an AI-augmented environment.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS  

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 15, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Briefly Description:** The event focused on AWS AI/ML/GenAI services, starting with an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam, followed by an introduction and live demonstration of Amazon SageMaker—the end-to-end platform for developing and deploying machine learning models. The session covered data preparation, model training, tuning, deployment, and integrated MLOps. The latter part introduced Amazon Bedrock with foundation models (Claude, Llama, Titan), prompt engineering techniques, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, Bedrock Agents, and safety measures. A highlight was the live demo of building a Generative AI chatbot using Bedrock.

&emsp;**Outcomes:** Through the event, I gained a clearer understanding of building and deploying AI/ML solutions on AWS, learned new techniques in prompt engineering and RAG, and how to select suitable foundation models. I also learned to use Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock for real-world AI applications, and recognized the importance of safety and content control in next-generation AI systems.
