### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** AI-Driven Development Life Cycle

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 14:00, October 03, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Briefly Description:** The event introduced AWS’s new AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (AI-DLC) — a methodology that integrates Artificial Intelligence across all phases of software development: inception, construction, and operations. <br>&emsp;
 Main activities included keynote presentations by AWS experts, live demonstrations of AI-assisted coding and deployment, hands-on sessions using AWS tools (such as Amazon CodeWhisperer and Kiro IDE), and interactive discussions on how human-AI collaboration reshapes modern development workflows. 

&emsp;**Outcomes:** Through the event, I gained insights into how AI can act as a proactive collaborator rather than just a support tool. I learned the principles of AI-native software development, where automation, continuous feedback, and human oversight coexist.<br>&emsp;
The workshop enhanced my technical understanding of agentic workflows and AI-powered code generation, as well as soft skills like adaptability and teamwork in an AI-augmented environment.
