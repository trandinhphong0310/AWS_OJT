### Week 2 Achievements:

* Successfully tested connectivity by creating a NAT Gateway and configuring an EC2 endpoint.

* Created and managed key pairs, initialized a CloudFormation Template, and set up Hybrid DNS with Route 53.

* Configured Security Groups, connected to RDGW, set up DNS, and created a Route 53 outbound endpoint for validation.

* Practiced resource cleanup by setting up VPC Peering, creating Security Groups, and launching new EC2 instances.

* Updated Network ACLs, established a Peering Connection, configured Route Tables, and enabled cross-VPC DNS resolution.
